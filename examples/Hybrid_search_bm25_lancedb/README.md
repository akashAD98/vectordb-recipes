## Hybrid Search with BM25 and LanceDB

### About BM25
BM25 is a sophisticated ranking function used in information retrieval. Acting like a highly efficient librarian, it excels in navigating through extensive collections of documents. Its effectiveness lies in:

Term Frequency: Evaluating how often search terms appear in each document.
Document Length Normalization: Ensuring a fair chance for both short and long documents in search results.
Bias-Free Information Retrieval: Ideal for large data sets where unbiased results are critical.
About LanceDB (VectorDB)
LanceDB extends our search capabilities beyond mere keyword matching. It brings in a layer of contextual understanding, interpreting the semantics of search queries to provide results that align with the intended meaning.

### Hybrid Search Approach
Our hybrid search system synergizes BM25's keyword-focused precision with LanceDB's semantic understanding. This duo delivers nuanced, comprehensive search results, perfect for complex and varied datasets.

### Implementation
BM25's Role: Quick identification of documents based on specific keywords.
LanceDB's Magic: Deep semantic analysis to align search results with query intent.
Combined Power: Harmonizing both methods for superior search accuracy and relevance.
