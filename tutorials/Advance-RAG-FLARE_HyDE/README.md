## FLARE and HyDE: Advanced AI Solutions for Content Generation and Information Retrieval
This repository is dedicated to showcasing the implementation of two groundbreaking technologies in AI - FLARE (Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation) and HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings). These tools represent significant advancements in content generation and information retrieval.

Overview
The project is structured around two main components:

FLAREChain for ArXiv Paper Q&A: An application (app.py) that demonstrates the FLARE technology, enabling users to ask questions directly to academic papers, particularly focusing on ArXiv papers.

HyDE: A Colab notebook implementation demonstrating the HyDE technology for advanced information retrieval without the need for relevance labels.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can install these using the requirements.txt file provided in this repository.

Running the FLAREChain App
To run the FLAREChain Q&A application for ArXiv papers:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing app.py
3. Run the command: 
```python3 app.py ```

The Gradio app should now be running and accessible for interactions.

### Accessing the HyDE Colab Notebook
